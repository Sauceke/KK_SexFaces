![showcase-chan](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76826783/113476784-3ff06f80-946d-11eb-9704-cf03261b5a02.png)
Adds the ability to set custom facial expressions to be displayed during H scenes (as opposed to the ones hardcoded into the game).

Also extends the range of facial expressions accessible from the character editor.

Originally forked from ManlyMarco's [KK_SkinEffects plugin](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KK_SkinEffects), but modified beyond recognition.

## Installation
1. Install [KKAPI](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KKAPI) and its dependencies.
1. Download the DLL from the latest release and move it into BepInEx\plugins under your game directory.
1. Rejoice

## Usage
Sex faces can be added individually for each character, using the ❤ -> Sex Faces menu inside the Character Editor. You can set a sex face for each combination of sexual experience and context (foreplay, insertion, orgasm). You don't have to add a face for every combination, the rest will be handled by the game as usual.

Extra facial expressions can be set in the same menu, under Extra Expression Controls.
